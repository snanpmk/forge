# Forge: Your Personal Life Operating System

Welcome to **Forge**, a comprehensive digital companion designed to help you organize your life, build one atomic habit at a time, and achieve your personal goals. Think of it not just as a journal, but as an *Operating System* for your daily life—combining productivity, spirituality, and finance into one beautiful, easy-to-use experience.

## 🌟 What is Forge?

Forge is built on the philosophy that small, consistent actions lead to massive results. It replaces scattered apps for to-do lists, habit tracking, and journaling with a single, unified dashboard. It is designed to be visually calming and motivating, using a modern aesthetic that makes you *want* to use it every day.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **The Dashboard (Your Command Center)**
Your day starts here. The Dashboard greets you personally based on the time of day and gives you a snapshot of what matters most right now:
*   **Prayer Schedule:** See your next prayer time instantly.
*   **Active Habits:** Check off daily habits quickly.
*   **Goal Progress:** Visual bars showing how close you are to your targets.
*   **Quick Insights:** A summary of your finances and pending tasks.

### 2. **Habit Tracker**
Build consistency with a powerful habit tracking system.
*   **Streaks:** Watch your streak numbers go up as you complete habits daily.
*   **Visual History:** See your monthly progress at a glance.
*   **Gamified:** Earning XP (experience points) for every habit you keep helps you "level up" your profile.

### 3. **Task Manager & Brain Dump**
Stop carrying everything in your head.
*   **Brain Dump:** A dedicated space to quickly type out every thought, idea, or worry to clear your mind.
*   **Task Organization:** Convert those thoughts into actionable tasks with due dates.
*   **Focus:** Keep track of what needs to be done today, tomorrow, or later.

### 4. **Spiritual Growth (Prayer Tracker)**
Stay connected to your spiritual duties.
*   **Prayer Times:** Accurate daily times for Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha.
*   **Logging:** Mark prayers as 'Done' or 'On-Time' to track your spiritual consistency.

### 5. **Financial Clarity**
Take control of your money without complex spreadsheets.
*   **Income & Expense:** Log transactions easily.
*   **Monthly Snapshot:** Instantly see if you are saving or overspending (Income vs. Expense).

### 6. **Goal Setting**
Turn dreams into reality.
*   **Set Targets:** Define clear goals (e.g., "Read 12 Books", "Save $5000").
*   **Track Progress:** Manually update your progress and watch the progress bars fill up.

## 🎮 Gamification: Level Up Your Life

Forge makes productivity fun by treating your life like a role-playing game (RPG).
*   **Earn XP:** You gain Experience Points (XP) for almost everything good you do—finishing a task, completing a habit, or logging a prayer.
*   **Level Up:** As you gain XP, your digital "User Level" increases. It’s a rewarding way to visualize your personal growth over time.

## 📱 Mobile Experience (PWA)
Forge is designed to go where you go.
*   **Installable App:** Add Forge to your home screen on iOS or Android—no app store required.
*   **App-Like Feel:** Runs full-screen with smooth transitions, removing the browser "feeling" so you can focus on your life.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

We believe productivity tools shouldn't be boring. Forge features:
*   **Premium Aesthetic:** Clean typography, glass-like transparency, and subtle animations.
*   **Focus Mode:** A clutter-free interface that helps you concentrate.
*   **Deep Personalization:** Choose between Light, Dark, Midnight, and Nature themes to match your mood and environment.
*   **Your Journey:** Your avatar and progress travel with you everywhere.
